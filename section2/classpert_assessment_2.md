## Assessment Questions

**1. Evaluate the function** $ \text{log}_{3}81 $:

    a. 4 (correct answer)

    b. 3 

    c. -2 

    d. e


FEEDBACK: A logarithm calculates a power for a given base. In this case, we are asking "3 raised to what power gives 81?" which would be $ 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 $ so that is a power of 4. 

**2. A derivative of a function calculates...**

    a. Where a function divides by 0

    b. The area under that function

    c. A limit approaching a specific point 

    d. The slope/gradient of that function (correct answer)

FEEDBACK: A derivative allows us to calculate the slope/gradient at any given point of a function easily, such as the derivative $ f(x) = x^2 $ is $ f'(x) = 2x $. This means at $ x = 2 $, the slope is $ 4 $. 

**3. The learning rate in gradient descent...**

    a. Controls how fast the algorithm moves to a minimum while trading off with accuracy. (correct answer)

    b. Controls how smart the "AI" is 

    c. Controls how many iterations are performed

    d. Calculates the derivative for a given function


FEEDBACK: A learning rate controls how fast the algorithm moves to a minimum at the cost of accuracy. While it will require more iterations the smaller it is, it does not control iterations nore does it calculate the derivative.
