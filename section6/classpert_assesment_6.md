## Assessment Questions

1. True/False - A data scientist's job is set up to always contributes value.

   a. True
   
   b. False [correct answer]

FEEDBACK: It is common for managers to hire a data scientist but not have a clearly defined role for them. This creates a work situation where the data scientist is not creating value for the organization and it is important to monitor for this. 


2. When getting insights from data, it is ideally best practice to....

   a. Gather data first then create hypotheses around it.
   
   b. Create a hypothesis first and then gather data around it. [correct answer]
   
   c. Collect as much data as possible across every possible variable.

FEEDBACK: It is better to use the scientific method if possible instead of data mining, which hypothesizes then gathers data, rather than gathers data then hypothesizes. You want to structure around a controlled variable and be careful to not gather too much data with too many variables, without a specific objective.
   

3. When a manager asks you to create a model that with a predetermined outcome, you should...

   a. Be concerned as this is p-hacking [correct answer]

   b. Be okay as long as you find data that supports the outcome

   c. Be okay since you have a clear objective

FEEDBACK: When you have a predetermined outcome before you even have done any modeling, hypothesis testing, or machine learning that's a precarious situation. This creates a cherry-picking objective resulting in p-hacking, rather than openly exploring the question without a favored outcome.
